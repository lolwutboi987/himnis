himnis (hi, my name is [what?])
Himnis is a stylish little eink nametag, because the stickers just dont cut it. It can also display graphics, and other info (such as blog qr codes, tags, or lots of text you canâ€™t write by hand). 
Thanks to the eink display, himnis needs no power to retain an image once updated, however for moving graphics it can be powered by any usbc power source.
